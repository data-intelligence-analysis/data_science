    Task #4: Plot the word cloud
    Task #5: Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
    Task #6: Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
    Task #7: Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
    Task #8: Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
    Task #9: Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers
    Task #10: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
    Task #11: Assess trained model performance

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
