# <u>NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis</u>

##Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

    1. Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
    2. Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
    3. Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
    4. Understand the concept of count vectorization (tokenization)
    5. Perform tokenization to tweet text using Scikit Learn
    6. Understand the theory and intuition behind Naïve Bayes classifiers
    7. Understand the difference between prior probability, posterior probability and likelihood
    8. Train Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to preform classification
    9. Evaluate the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices
