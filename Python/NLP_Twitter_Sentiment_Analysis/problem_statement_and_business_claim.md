# TASK #1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE

  1. Natual language processors (NLP) work by converting words (text) into numbers. 
  2. These numbers are then use to train an AI/ML model to make predictions.
  3. Predictions could be sentiment inferred from social media posts and product reviews.
  4. AI/ML - based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to automatically predict whether their coustomers are happy or not.
  5. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 
  6. IN this case study we will analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict people's sentiment.
  
  <u>Tweet</u>                                                                                                <u>Sentiment</u>
  "Good Morning everyone! Such a beautiful day"                    -> (SENTIMENT ANALYSIS NLP MODEL) ->       POSITIVE(LABEL = 0)
  "Don't fly an xx airline their customer service is horrendous"   -> (SENTIMENT ANALYSIS NLP MODEL) ->       NEGATIVE(LABEL = 1)
