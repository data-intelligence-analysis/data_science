# Project Objectives

## In this project, we are going to focus on five learning objectives:

    By the end of task 1, you will be able to load a dataset from file.
    By the end of task 2, you will be able to process a dataset so that it can be modelled.
    By the end of task 3, you will be able to split a dataset into training and testing sets.
    By the end of task 4, you will be able to fit a decision tree to a dataset and make predictions.
    By the end of task 5, you will be able to prune a decision tree to improve its accuracy.
    By the end of task 6, you will be able to generate a graphical representation of a decision tree.

By the end of this project, you will be able to model an existing dataset with the goal of making predictions about new data.  
You will be able to generate a visualization of a decision tree and explain how it makes predictions.

# Project Structure

## This project is divided into 3 parts:

    Project Overview: This introductory reading material.
    Decision Trees: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
    

Structure

The hands on project on Predicting Salaries with Decision Trees is divided into following tasks:
Task 1: Load a dataset from file
Task 2: Process a dataset so that it can be modelled
Task 3: Split our dataset into training and testing sets
Task 4: Fit a decision tree to a dataset and make predictions
Task 5: Prune a decision tree to improve its accuracy
Task 6: Generate a graphical representation of a decision tree


# Decision Trees

## Now we will build a decision tree and use it to predict salaries. We will accomplish this by completing each task in the project:

    Task 1: Load a dataset from file
    Task 2: Process a dataset so that it can be modelled
    Task 3: Split our dataset into training and testing sets
    Task 4: Fit a decision tree to a dataset and make predictions
    Task 5: Prune a decision tree to improve its accuracy
    Task 6: Generate a graphical representation of a decision tree
