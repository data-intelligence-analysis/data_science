# Objectives
## In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    1. Selecting a Region of Interest and Extract Features from it, so it will be your Training Dataset.
    2. Getting Introduced to Several Numpy Functions.
    3. Label the Training Dataset.

## By the end of this course, you will be able to Create Training Dataset and Label it.

# Course Structure

## This course is divided into 3 parts:

    1. Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
    2. Preparing Data for Machine Learning Models: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
    3. Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

# Project Structure

## The hands on project on Preparing Data for Machine Learning Models is divided into following tasks:
    Task 1: Introduction and Setup

    Task 2: Selecting ROI

    Task 3: Features as Numpy Arrays
    
    Task 4: Concatenate the 2 Features Array and Label the Training Dataset.
    
    Task 5: Final Training Dataset Preprocessing
