# Objectives
## We are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    1. Selecting a Region of Interest and Extract Features from it, so it will be your Training Dataset.
    2. Getting Introduced to Several Numpy Functions.
    3. Label the Training Dataset.

## By the end of this project, I should be able to Create a Training Dataset and Label it.


# Project Structure

## The hands on project on Preparing Data for Machine Learning Models is divided into following tasks:
    Task 1: Introduction and Setup

    Task 2: Selecting ROI

    Task 3: Features as Numpy Arrays
    
    Task 4: Concatenate the 2 Features Array and Label the Training Dataset.
    
    Task 5: Final Training Dataset Preprocessing
